# PopularMovies
This is an android app which I made from scratch as a part of Android Developer Nanodegree program. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.
Please note : In order to build and run the code, you need to request an API key from themoviedb.org. Create your account here: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup
## Features
With the app, you can:

- Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
- Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
- Watch trailers
- Read reviews
